# Prints the numbers from 1-100 except:
  first we have to determine our variable (i)
  then we can write a function with that variable
  it will count until 100 for each time and it will logout a value of variable each time
  when the number reach 100 it will break the functions.
  
# For multiples of five, print “Power”
  when the value reach multiples of 5 we have to write if function like i%sayi==0; sayi=5;
  then we will print it out

# For multiples of seven, print “Coders”
  we will do the same thing but this time sayi1=7;
  then we we will print it out

# For multiples of five and seven, print “PowerCoders”
  we will do the same thing but this time sayi2=35;
  then we we will print it out
