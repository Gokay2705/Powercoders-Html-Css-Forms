  4. Describe **in words** a program called **PowerCoders**, which does the following:

     *  For multiples of seven, print ‚ÄúCoders‚Äù
     *  For multiples of five and seven, print ‚ÄúPowerCoders‚Äù
    
    Describe in words how you would write such a program. Make sure to write out each step clearly. Imagine you have to explain to a non-coder what you want to do and why. This part of the exercise does not ask for any code.
