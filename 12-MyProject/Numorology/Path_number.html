            <h2>What is Numerology?</h2>
            <p> Every number, every letter in the universe is associated with a planet.
                It is called <strong>Ebced</strong> in Turkish-Islamic culture and
                <strong> Numerology </strong> in Europe. Each of us has numbers, which
                are depicted by the fateful effects of our life, according to our names,
                to our dates of birth. These numbers help us to decipher our own codes
                about what planet they represent and what planet they represent in our
                lives.
            </p>
            <p> Numerology can be used to find direction and meaning in your life. It can also be used for forecasting,
                to see what kind of energy will be influencing you in the future. Many people even use Numerology as a
                resource when naming a child or business. The numbers present in a name impact its overall personality
                and potential, so some will put great intention into choosing a name that brings the desired results.
            </p>
            <p><em> Your birthday</em> is made up entirely of numbers. Even the letters in your name correspond with specific
                numbers. There are numbers in your age, your address, your phone number, your paycheck... <em>They are all
                around you -- and within you! </em>
            </p>
            <p> The most direct way that they affect your energies is from your very own
                Numerology chart. The numbers in your chart -- like your Life Path and other core numbers -- influence
                you in very personal ways because they are derived from YOUR birth date and full name. Keep reading to
                learn more about what's in your Numerology chart, but first, let's talk about some important numbers!
