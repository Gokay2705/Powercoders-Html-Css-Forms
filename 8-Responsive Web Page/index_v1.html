          our life, according to our <em>names</em>, to our

          kind of energy will be influencing you in the future. Your birthday is
          made up entirely of numbers. Even the letters in your name correspond
          with specific numbers. There are numbers in your age, your address,
          your phone number, your paycheck... They are all around you -- and
          within you!

          numerological analysis of information such as a person's date of birth
          and name. e number of life purpose is usually between 1 and 9. Each
          number has its own meaning and reflects one's life journey and life
          purpose. One's life purpose number provides information about one's
          <strong><em>life journey, abilities and potentials</em></strong
